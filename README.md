Title: House of Javascript

I want to be able to pride myself in knowing that i contribute to a bigger picture in helping others by not only just solving problems but creating options that solve them as well. 

I am an experienced IT Analyst that with a wide background in supporting end users. When it comes to problem solving it is not just a job to me but I pride myself in learning tools to help others. The best form I have found for that just so happens to have found my down a software developer career now. 

I love solving problems in the tech word. It's almost more satisfying than a really good bacon cheeseburger.
